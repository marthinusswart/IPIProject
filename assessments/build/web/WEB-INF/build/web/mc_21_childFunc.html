		<p><b>Child Functioning</b></p>
		<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
		<p>The most perturbing factor in countries social development is the very high rate of suicide in the young people between the ages of 13 and 21 years. This social problem is world wide and is on the increase.</p>
  		<p><b>The question is why?</b></p>
  		<p>Nobody has really been able to answer the question consistently although there are many theories. Drugs, smoking, drinking, gangs and teenage suicide are spiraling out of control.</p>
      	<p>Firstly, <b>in our opinion</b>, one of the major factors contributing to this, is diet and secondly the child's feeling of worthlessness and helplessness. This lack of self worth begins when a child can do whatever they please without been reprimanded effectively.</p>
      	<p>One starts to recognizing the problem with the symptoms of attention deficiency disorder (ADD) starts raising its head, as the children are seeking means to attract attention to
      	themselves. One of the main reasons for this disorder is, that boundaries are not clearly identified or set, neither are they enforced by parents, so the child cannot differentiate between right and wrong, good or bad.
      	Lack of discipline from the time the child is very young causes the child a lot of inner insecurity. The most important development stage in a child's life is 6 -12 yrs. Let us discuss this age group as a start.</p>
  		<p><b>Children 6-12 years</b></p>
  		<p>The modern parents of today are brain-washed into thinking that they can develop their children by rational discussion. Unfortunately during this phase children are not capable
      	of complete rational understanding or thinking. Discipline is an essential tool to be used during this early development stage of a child and will create a rock foundation for their future. Discipline will give a child a sense of belonging and security.</p>
  		<p>Boundaries have to be set and those boundaries have to be enforced at all times. This enforcement of boundaries must be administered consistently and fairly by
      	parents and must not be administered when the parents are angry. Without discipline the child losers respect for the parents and develops a sense of inner insecurity, guilt feelings and worthlessness.</p>
  		<p>This leads to anger, arrogance and disrespect. To love your child is to discipline your child. An undisciplined child is loved by none. If the child is not
      	disciplined the child pays the price of rejection and insecurity. Before adolescence children must be able to understand that their parents
      	are their source of love, position and worth, giving them the sense of security. Openness between children and parents (trust) is an essential ingredient for successful development during adolescence.</p>
  		<p>A well read publication says: <b>"He that spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him"</b> </p>
  		<p>During this phase it is essential that children understand their importance and value. However, <a href="#">Value Intelligence</a> describes the definition of <b>values</b> thoroughly.</p>
  		<p>Any adult or parent while being a parent must function effectively by setting the example of love, position and worth. Unfortunately many parents in themselves are not functioning effectively.</p>
  		<p>Child abuse, child rape etc are all by-products of worthlessness and helplessness in the abuser and not always a mental illness. Free choice always over rules the thinking.</p>
  		<p>Functioning from the above perspective leads to anger and/or frustration which then causes the abuse. People sometimes use the excuse; "I can't help myself " in reality they can but a lack of conative functioning (will power) is why they seemingly feel helpless.</p>
  		<p><b>Adolescence 13-18 years old</b></p>
  		<p>Upon reaching adolescence the child becomes increasingly capable of rational thinking. This is the time when outside pressures start playing a huge part in a child's life. Should the child
      	not have had the foundation as discussed above, and does not understand their personal values as a foundation, the child will not cope with life's daily pressures, resulting in a slow descent into a dysfunctional mode and this spiral downwards would cause the child to turn to something that will assist the child to "cope" or escape reality, into a world of deception and fantasy, often ending in suicide.</p>
  		<p>There are many parents today <b>that do not</b> have a clue how their children are functioning. Some think because a child might be doing well at school or sport that the child is functioning optimally. Should the personal values of the child not be satisfied, they will enter into a "coping" mode that looks as if they are functioning efficiently.</p>
  		<p>It is essential that parents are able to identify the "coping" mode syndrome early. Should the parent not be able to do this, catastrophe could result in attempts or successful
      	suicide. The reality is that parents should be fine tuned to their child's behaviour and comments, and not react flippantly to any frustration or remarks indicating their self worth. i.e. I do not know why
      	I was born, I am a useless individual etc. Should a child make any such remarks it would be essential that the child receives professional intervention.</p>
  		<p>The real perturbing fact is that the above scenarios can be averted by early detection and action, but are ignored and categorized into growing pains. The reality is that very rarely are these symptoms addressed and thus at the end of the day tragedy strikes.</p>
  		<p>The first signs of breakdown are normally advanced stages of dysfunctionality, and then the candidate has already turned to some form of escape such as excessive sleep,
      	smoking, drinking or even drugs, for some time and could be in an advanced stage of feeling worthless and helpless. I see clients regularly that are excellent parents but they do not understand
      	the hierarchy of personal values of their child, and are really shocked to learn that their child is in a serious state of false perceptions.</p>
  		<p>Society, teaches our children that premarital sex is acceptable. Adolescent sex is wrong as there is no responsibility or accountability by the child for their own behaviour. Any teenage girl if she understands her personal value, will not allow her body to be abused for the frustration or escape of a male, all in the deception of love.</p>
  		<p>The solution to the problem is to insure that at least once yearly, your child's functionality is measured professionally, so potential problem areas can be resolved by solutions in the early stage of manifestation.</p>
 		<p>It is even of greater importance to realize that the total functionality of the child is considered and to do this we recommend the <b>High School- Personal Profile</b> which includes guidance
      	through scientifically identifying the subjects for a career of fulfilment and purpose.</p>
 		<p><b>Assess your child in privacy and in the comfort of your home.</b></p>
