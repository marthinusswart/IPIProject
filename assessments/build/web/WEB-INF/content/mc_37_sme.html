<h3>Small and Medium Size Business</h3>

<p>The reality of running a small business in the modern world today becomes more and more challenging, as the efficiency and availability of skilled staff becomes less and less accessible.</p>

<p>The  reasons are :</p>
	
<ul>
<li>Because of the accelerated pace in technology, and the lack of up-to-date training facilities worldwide.</li>
<li>The cost of training has become excessive, due to the need of having to send staff overseas for training.</li>
<li>The exchange rates in various countries have become a contributing factor in the cost of training.</li>
<li>The lack of ability to find the correct candidate to be trained into a particular skill.</li>
<li>The lack and unwillingness of financial institutions to assist small businesses in development projects.</li>
<li>The laws and red tape in abiding within the parameters of the laws, such as labour, empowerment, different taxes etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the fact that small and medium businesses cannot afford specialized staff, resulting in the owners having  to be the "jack of all trades", i.e. accountant, manager, human resource officer, safety and security and many other duties. </p>

<p>People have the false perception, that running one's own business is relatively easy.</p>

<p>Many skilled tradesman open businesses and are experts in their field, but if they do not have the numerous business skills, they go out of business within the first three years. The ultimate reason for this is that the once skilled  tradesman now becomes the unskilled entrepreneur.</p>

<p>The reality is, that in big organizations, if twenty or thirty percent of the staff  are inefficient the likelihood of identifying the problem would be remote. However, in small and medium businesses it becomes catastrophic and management then starts putting out fires, instead of focusing and remaining focused on WHY they went into business in the first place.</p>

<p>The following elements are necessary to obtain optimal performance, efficiency and harmony within the business:</p>
	
<ul>
<li>The environmental elements: (i.e. accounts, sales, management, production departments, etc) job definitions must be clearly defined through a scientific measurement system known as the Job Profile.</li>
<li>Each staff member has to complete the organization screening inventory to determine the holistic functionality of the staff members within their working environment.</li>
<li>The management or supervisors must understand the subordinate's functionality preferences.</li>
<li>The Organization Screening Inventory must be in harmony with the Job Profile. This is known as "The Match".</li>
<li>People who are not in harmony with the match, need to be identified.</li>
<li>Once identified, corrective action must be implemented in order to satisfy this criteria. Specialized intervention would be necessary. </li>
<li>The management must have a functioning profile which is conducive to the environment in which they manage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The outcome, due to the scientific nature of the exercise would be accurate and effective in obtaining the desired result.</p>
