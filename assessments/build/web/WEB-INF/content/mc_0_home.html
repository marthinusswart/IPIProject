<h2>Introduction</h2>
<i>(by Dr. Whitehouse)</i>
<p>We invite you to consider how in the working, home, school or social environment, each role plays out into different systems that affect human behaviour and attitudes.</p>

<p>The question may arise what exactly do we mean by the above statement?</p>

<p>Simply explaining a very complex subject, it is:</p>
	
<ul>
<li>The holistic personal importance of likes and dislikes.</li>
<li>Personal belief systems between right or wrong making up different preferences known as <i>personal values within a specific environment</i>.</li>
<li><i>Quantifying</i> the intensity of <i>the effect</i> of each of those preferences or personal values within a defined environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>History tells us that education and personality perceptions are the key for a fit to a particular job or occupation.  This of course is not correct, because despite the proper qualifications, competency and personalities in the job, the situation may end up in disaster, should the working environment not be conducive to the individual's personal values or profile.</p>

<h4>My personal experience will illustrate the point:</h4>

<p>In 1962 I was recruited into the Air Force and was very fortunate to be selected as a trainee pilot. I learned how to do precision flying, where we flew in formation, did spins, loops, and stalls, which were most stimulating, as each manoeuvre had to be carried out with precision.</p>

<p>In this situation one could exercise personal values such as ability utilization (competency), challenging attributes, self development, risk and many other values that were satisfied by this type of environment.</p>

<p>After completing my training, I was lured away by money and because money was important to me, I went to fly large passenger jets commercially.  After approximately eight months I became very dissatisfied as a commercial pilot, due to the fact that the environment in which I was working had changed drastically in comparison to flying Harvard's in the Air Force.</p>

<p>I became a nightmare to my Captain at the time, because my attitude became aggressive and very incompetent. The reality was that I was bored stiff and hated the commercial pilot's environment. The fact was, I was a very competent pilot in the Air Force and became a very incompetent pilot in a commercial airline.</p>

<h4>What was the difference?</h4>

<p>Plainly, it was the environment change that had changed my life so dramatically. The issue is that environment identification and understanding is crucial to lead a fulfilled lifestyle, and it is the personal values of importance that leads to discovering your true inner potential. This of course is critical, should you wish to live an ideal and satisfied lifestyle.</p>
