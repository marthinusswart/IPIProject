<h3>Recruitment</h3>

<p>The problems that arise out of recruiting the wrong person for a particular job has horrendous outcomes.</p>

<p>Research has proved that the modern systems of recruiting people is out of touch with the reality, in so far as the majority of people recruited are not suitable and become huge liabilities to business owners and fellow staff members alike.</p>

<p>Let us discuss this process and look at the illogical methods of recruiting a candidate for a position in any business.</p>
	
<ul>
<li>A company or business would either advertise a job profile, requesting certain criteria needed to fulfill a vacancy in the business.</li>
<li>Most adverts contain the following criteria:
   <ul>
   <li>The necessary qualifications</li>
   <li>The candidate must be hard working and dedicated</li>
   <li>The candidate must have traceable references</li>
   <li>The candidate must have experience</li>
   <li>The candidate must enjoy working as part of a team</li>
   <li>The candidate must be self motivated, etc</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>The candidate then fills in a Curriculum Vitae with all their details, including all the necessary above criteria.</li>
<li>The recruiter then processes the applications by checking for certain keywords or criteria.</li>
<li>A list is then compiled from the applications and interviews are then setup.</li>
<li>The candidates then does  various tests and are interviewed  by a recruiter.</li>
<li>A shortlist is compiled.</li>
<li>The candidates go back for another two or three interviews with other people or recruiters.</li>
<li>Then, by a democratic vote, a candidate is chosen. This of course is not the case in a small business, where the candidate is chosen through the owners perception.</li>
<li>A candidate is then chosen.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The question arises:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Is the chosen candidate the correct candidate and how would one know?</li>
<li>Will the candidate be happy in the job offered to them?</li>
<li>Will the employer be satisfied with the candidate?</li>
<li>Will the candidate fulfil the criteria of the employer as communicated via the briefing from the employer, to the advertiser, to the recruitment agency or human resource department. Critical information may be lost each time that the information is given from the one to the other. Is the impression that the last person has of what is wanted really what the first person (the employer) had in mind?</li>
</ol>

<h4>The Snare:</h4>

<p>Let us look at the information as discussed above and look at the pitfalls in the system.</p>

<ul>
<li>The candidate does a CV. Today there are professional CV writers and they are experienced in keywords.  What does that tell you about the candidate? Nothing at all, except that one knows the candidate's personal particulars.</li>
<li>The candidate who cannot afford to hire a professional CV writer and who wrote his own CV, may not know the keywords, yet may have the abilities necessary for the job, and then the system would bypass that candidate.</li>
<li>A one-on-one interview creates a perception with the recruiter that may be inaccurate. Perceptions and preferences are based on invalid or unjust systems.</li>
<li>The various tests that are done are not scientific and therefore once again, are subjective to interpretation by a recruitment specialist - once again perception plays its part.</li>
<li>The various tests are very easy to manipulate if one understands the questions being asked. It has been claimed that the recruitment officer is able to detect manipulation. After many years of research we have found that almost 90% of these assessments can be manipulated without detection.</li>
<li>There are professional mentors and coaches who coach applicants on how best to ensure a high success rate with their CV and presentation to the organization. Therefore a perception comes into play again which influences the final decision.</li>
<li>The reality is that recruitment with its current methods are really based on someone's perception or gut feel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recruitment Solutions:</h3>

<h4>Business</h4>

<p>Business today, needs to recruit and create optimal efficiency and productivity by selecting staff who effectively can work in harmony with their colleagues, as well as give a return on output to make their existence viable. To do this they need to make sure that their selection becomes the "First Time Right" criteria.</p>

<p>Many businesses are in a loop. Their staff turnaround factor becomes costly, as each time a staff member leaves, the cost of replacing the staff member is high, i.e. recruitment and training costs, and the business never seems to get up to speed due to this factor. This is a serious problem in call centres and insurance companies where staff turnaround is as high as 60%.</p>

<p>Research shows that the majority of managers manage through fear. In other words: "if you do not achieve your tasks, we will replace you with someone who can". That sounds easy, but the knock-on effect is that the situation worsens because the staff member becomes de-motivated and discontented leading to a drop in efficiency or drop-out rate due to the resignation of that staff member. The answer would be to have a staff member who has an ability utilization (competency) level that is important to them.</p>

<p>To solve all these problems the FQGlobal Group offers a scientific job description inventory, that would calculate the necessary job criteria according to importance, within that job environment. Once the job profile has been established, including the environmental effect on the job, then that job criteria has been scientifically quantified, and all perceptions are removed.</p>

<h4>The Candidate</h4>

<p>The candidate completes the FQGlobal Group's holistic functioning profile, which determines the candidates holistic functionality, including their hierarchy of values according to importance. These personal values of the candidate are then scientifically matched against the values of the job profile.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The matching of the two profiles leads to the successful recruitment of a candidate who would produce a very high level of competency. Any change in the environment could affect the functionality of different candidates negatively. </p>
