		<h3>Personal Assessment</h3>
		<p><b>How</b> would one know <b>how</b> one is functioning or performing as a person?</p>
  		<p align=center><img border="0" src="images/performance.gif"></p>
  		<p>Can you tell with validity and reliability on a score from 0-100, how you are performing in relationship to your inner potential?</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The only way one would know, is by a reliable and valid means of measurement. </li>
				<li>This measurement is known as <b>Functional Intelligence</b> as described under <a href="index.jsp?pg=1">definitions</a>.</li>
				<li>Up until the introduction of Functional Intelligence there was no means to quantify human performance based on the criteria effecting the human behaviour holistically, within their specific environment.</li>
				<li>Psycho-analysis can however test various skills or proficiencies, but never the functionality of the congruent, holistic man within a specific environment.</li>
				<li>The core criteria in measuring any human functioning; <b>is </b>environment.</li>
				<li>Without the inclusion of the environment in any quantification or measurement of human functioning, the information becomes non-effective.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>It is very important to understand that it is not the problem that is a priority in assisting a candidate, but the effect that the problem has on the functionality of the candidate.</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>An example of this is that we mostly treat the symptom in stead of the cause.</li>
				<li>An example of a symptom is withdrawal, known as depression.</li>
				<li>The true problem is not depression but the cause of the depression.</li>
				<li>The root cause of depression lies within criteria such as helplessness and worthlessness.</li>
				<li>The error is we address the symptom with chemicals, anti-depressants, which of course will never solve the cause, but would artificially make one feel better due to the fact that the cause depletes the necessary serotonin's and endorphins necessary within the body.</li>
				<li>The reality is that as soon as you stop the chemicals, you would return to a lower level of functioning; than you were prior to the intake of the said chemicals.</li>
				<li>This is not a mental disease, but rather a self perception which is a false inner picture. </li>
				<li>Change the self-perception by understanding that what your self perception is, is only a perception and not the reality.</li>
				<li>Nobody is worthless.</li>
				<li>Nobody is helpless.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h4>People function from six separate constructs or areas:</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Positive Functioning.</li>
				<li>Negative Functioning.</li>
				<li>Self Perceptions.</li>
				<li>Relationships.</li>
				<li>Personal Values.</li>
				<li>Emotional Values.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>The top two above constructs; indicates both the Inner Interactive (self perception) and General Behavioral (self portrayal) systems. Hereafter described as the <b>IIS</b> and the <b>GBS</b>. Each of these systems are independent of each other and affect your functioning independently.</p>
		<p>The <b>IIS </b>system is the system that describes your inner feeling and your perception of what you believe about yourself. Many people keep the true feelings within themselves <b>(IIS)</b> and as a
      	result are labeled introverts. Therefore it becomes impossible without a reliable and valid means of measurement to determine if a person functionality is fully optimal.</p>
  		<p>In a recent survey of approximately 1000 people; we asked each person to describe how they were functioning as a holistic person.</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>100% of the candidates gave us unclear answers.</li>
				<li>Not one could confidently describe their functioning.</li>
				<li>82% said they really did not know.</li>
				<li>18% thought they were functioning satisfactorily. (Note only THOUGHT).</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
  		<p>The reality clearly indicates, they did not know!</p>
  		<p>The <b>GBS</b> is the system that gives you sight of peoples feelings and emotions. This is the only system that most people or companies understand. This is the biggest diversion from the reality of truth.</p>

		<table>
  			<tr><td><img border="0" src="images/mirror.gif" width="402" height="431"></td>

   		<td style="vertical-align:middle">
   			<h5>What do you see when you look in the mirror?</h5>
      		<p>Are you living in reality ?</p>
      		<p>Most people enjoy living in a fantasy, as it is an escape from the truth. Anything that is not true is a lie or fantasy.</p>
      		<p>Most people do not see themselves as other people see them.</p>
      		<p>People like to hide behind a mask of fantasy. You ask a person a simple question like "how are you"? The most probable answer is fine, thank you.</p>
      		<p>In reality they are not fine <b>(IIS)</b>, yet they look at face value <b>(GBS) </b>as if they are.</p>
           	<p>One can only disguise the truth by the <b>GBS </b>system.</p>
           	<p>The miracle of man is that in reality you cannot fool yourself <b>(IIS).</b></p>
      	</td></tr>
		</table>
 
     	<h4>Therefore this rationalization cannot be a psyche or mindset problem, for the following reasons:</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>The mind cannot be split into two functioning constructs <b>(IIS, GBS)</b> at the same time.</li>
				<li>You have a free choice in what you want to allow yourself to control in your functioning or thinking.</li>
				<li>Free Choice is the gift to un-slave yourself from any bondage, resulting from false self perceptions.</li>
				<li>The emphasis is on self, <b>which has the free choice to choose</b>, the mind does not choose.</li>
				<li>The mind only contains <u><b>all the knowledge</b></u> and information both positive and negative.</li>
				<li><b>Ultimately the self makes the choice.</b></li>
				<li>Self Perceptions, such as lack of self worth, inner insecurity and guilt feelings are the main reasons for non performance.</li>
				<li>These three above constructs effects your attitude which in turn effects your thinking and the way you function.</li>
				<li>Further you will react to your circumstances according to what personal values are important to you.</li>
				<li>You are therefore controlled by your <u><b>personal values</b></u> which controls your attitudes within self.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>Take a little time out now to think and understand this carefully. <b>This Is Most Important.</b></p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>We understand that it is most unlikely that you ever thought about this aspect of Human Functionality from this point of view.</li>
				<li>Some statistics claim that approx 79% of all the information you receive daily is negative.</li>
				<li>Obviously this percentage varies from person to person but without a doubt the majority of information received has a negative impact on most people's lives.</li>
				<li>One just has to read or watch the news daily on television, there is very little positive information.</li>
				<li>How one deals with these impact's depends on one's own ability to believe in their personal preferences and choices.</li>
				<li>The ability to understand your self-worth or value, is the key to ultimately set you free from the bondage of negative behavior or negative self perceptions.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Emotional Intelligence a word coined by psychologists Mayer and Salovey, 1997, were in they claim that people function from emotions. Many others such as David Caruzo (1999) define emotional intelligence as the ability to figure out and use strategies as a method of using emotions to achieve one goals, rather than to be used by emotions.</p>
				
		<div class='green3 emph'>
		<p><b>According to Dr. Neil A Whitehouse</b> (PhD Sociology: Functional Intelligence):</p>
		<p>
			<b><ul>
				<li><div class='green3 emph'>"Emotions are secondary constructs and are symptoms"</div></li>
				<li><div class='green3 emph'>"These symptoms v.i.z. emotions, are an indication expressing the results of an action within the primary functioning areas"</div></li>
				<li><div class='green3 emph'>"It therefore is unrealistic to measure an emotion without the inclusion of the environment and the primary factors; within that functionality of any individual"</div></li>
			</ul></b>
		</p>
		</div>
		<h5>Example 1:</h5>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>If someone wins a race of sorts, emotions express their inner feeling of satisfaction.</li>
				<li>It was the winning that is of primary importance to understand the reality in human functioning.</li>
				<li>Without the primary factor of winning or losing there would be no secondary reaction known as emotions.</li>
				<li>The emotions would be directly related to the environment i.e. whether the person won or lost.</li>
				<li>For this specific reason to base any type of functionality based on emotional intelligence, it would be floored due to the secondary nature of those emotions.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h5>Example 2:</h5>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Should a woman or child have been abused or assaulted for whatsoever cause arising.</li>
				<li>One will not be able to assist the person by working through the emotions although it is essential to approach the victim by allowing emotions to play themselves out.</li>
				<li>One would have to deal with the fact they were abused or assaulted. This causes a value of worthlessness and helplessness and therein lies the true problem.</li>
				<li>The strategy would be to make sure justice was satisfied i.e. the aggressor was punished for the deed.</li>
				<li>Establish an environment in which the candidates would no longer feel threatened.</li>
				<li>The victims need an understanding; that despite their misfortune; they must not be detracted from the reality of their personal value.</li>

      <h3>What exactly is <i>Value Intelligence&copy;</i></h3>
      	
      <ul>
      <li>Simply, it is the knowledge and understanding of one's own private, personal, and individual beliefs about what is most important to them within a defined environment. </li>
         <li>Your values are your belief system about what you classify as right or wrong, good or bad. </li>
         <li>Our values are the things we all fundamentally need to move towards, in an understanding of the congruent, or personal wholeness in the unity of self, which comes from the sense that we are fulfilling our very values, by our present behaviour within a defined environment. </li>
         <li>Our values govern our entire lifestyle. </li>
         <li>They also determine how we would respond to any given experience at any given time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Values are much like the Central Processing Unit in a computer: </h4>
      	
      <ul>
      <li>You can install any program or information you like, but whether the computer accepts the program or information or whether it uses it or not, all depends on how the CPU  was programmed by the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>Values are the Central Processing Unit of Judgment.</li>
      <li>Almost all of us have a bottom line - things that are more important to us, above anything else.</li>
      <li>For some people it is prestige, for others it is creativity. </li>
      <li>For others it will be important to be in the limelight all the time, including in their working environment, in order to fulfil their value of prestige. </li>
      <li>For another it will be much more important to be creative in their environment - prestige might not be an issue to them.  </li>
      <li>When one understand one's true values, you will understand why individuals do certain things, and why people do not enjoy the same things.</li>
      <li>Values are the key to unlock the door to a lifestyle of peace and prosperity. </li>
      <li>This understanding and knowledge of personal values according to importance, combined with clearly defined environmental values is called <i>Value Intelligence &copy;</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>To obtain a harmonious and ultimate lifestyle, we need the intelligence necessary to identify the constructs that are most important to us, by specifically knowing and understanding our hierarchy of personal values within a defined environment. </p>
      
      <p>Research shows that most people have great difficulty in understanding the basic behaviour or motivations in others, simply because the environment in which the functioning of personal values operate, are totally misunderstood.</p>
      	
      <ul>
         <li>Unless these principles are understood, chaos arises.</li>
         <li>Once a person understands another person's personal values, they can virtually predict how they would respond to any specific set of circumstances. </li>
         <li>There can be no real success, except in keeping with one's basic values within the environment in which they function.</li>
         <li>Sometimes it is a matter of learning how to mediate between existing values that are in conflict with each other.</li>
         <li>If a person never deals with people, while Interest in People is one of their main values, that person would never be content or satisfied in that job.</li>
         <li>No matter how much money one throws at them, they would never become ultimately satisfied.</li>
         <li>The problem lies in the higher level of conflicting values. </li>
         <li>The inner conflict and the feeling of incongruity needs to be addressed in order to solve this person’s lack of fulfilment in their working environment.  </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Amazingly enough, these problems are very seldom addressed by modern organizations.</p>

      <h4>Benefits of using the Functional Intelligence measuring system:</h4>
      <ul>	
         <li>Understanding your personal values.</li>
         <li>Reaching your personal purpose through knowledge.</li>
         <li>Understanding the system and roles that affect your functioning within the different environments.</li>
      </ul>
