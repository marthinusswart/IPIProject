<h3>Career Planning</h3>

<p>Thousands of school leavers are constantly unsure of what career path to follow. According to a small sample of approximately 2'000 students, only 23% knew exactly what career path they wanted to follow. After consulting with the 23%, it was discovered that in reality 14% of them, only <u>thought</u> they knew what they wanted to do. Thus leaving it at only 9% who exactly knew what career path they wanted to follow. The gross 77% of students were not sure or did not know at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of higher education today is enormous for the average parent to finance.</li>
<li>The tragedy is that most students end up in an occupation that they are really not designed to do.</li>
<li>Because they are then qualified in that job, they spend the rest of their lives in an occupation that never fulfills their Inner Potential.</li>
<li>The result being that without satisfaction in what you do, one never is able to reach a lifestyle of contentment and fulfillment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research shows that approximately 800 of the 2'000 students completed a career planner at school. All 800 confirmed that they were given a career planning report that was really worthless to them, because of the huge number of job options available that supposedly would satisfy the students personal purpose, leaving a large variety of jobs to choose from, of which very few could come near the candidate's personal purpose. This is like playing Russian Roulette with five bullets in the chamber making the planner an unacceptable method of career planning.</p>

<p>The knock-on effect of this is that Organizations are saddled with qualified personnel who are ineffective in their jobs, due to the fact that they are not interested in that job, but they feel secure in the field in which they were trained. Further, although they are fully trained, the environment in which they work lead them into a false satisfaction, where in the long term, reality plays its part, resulting in them never fulfilling their inner potential successfully. This of course results in self-dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>The FQGlobal Group through their scientific career planning inventory are able to determine precisely what is the motivator in one's life and gives one a sound foundation in how to discover their personal purpose. This system is the most reliable form of discovering your inner potential at an early age and then through a vision model, guide one into the career that would satisfy their inner potential.</p>

<p>However, it is very easy to be in a career that you really enjoy, but should that career be placed in the wrong environment, one could end up dysfunctional and sometimes think the fault lies in the career chosen, when ultimately you are in the wrong working environment.   </p>


<h4>First Time Right</h4>

<p>Many organizations and especially small businesses, find it almost impossible to find the correct person for their specific job environment, and vice versa, due to the conventional means of recruitment. Thus, neither of the parties arrive in a place where there is satisfaction and harmony, resulting in both discontentment by the employer and lack of satisfaction by the employee.</p>
