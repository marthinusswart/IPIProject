		<p><a href="index.jsp?pg=33">Mentors and Coaches</a></p>
  		<p>Mentors or Coaches have become very popular in the modern world of today and are alternative's to the conventional needs for assistance in human functioning and communication. Mentors assist people by guiding them into optimal functioning through the skill of communication.</p>
		<p><a href="index.jsp?pg=34">Recruitment</a></p>
  		<p>Recruitment has become a game of Russian roulette, and is subjective to perceptions of supposed experts in understanding how you function optimally. Certain assessments are done to establish your personality, emotional intelligence, assertiveness etc, without any consideration of the working environment.  These assessments become worthless, because the environment in which you work has not been clearly defined. We at the FQGlobal Group are the first to scientifically define the environment in which you work and match it to your personal profile.</p>
		<p><a href="index.jsp?pg=35">Turnaround Catalysts</a></p>
		<p>The FQGlobal Group are specialists in turning around people and businesses
        from a point of dysfunctioning or non performance into a position of
        absolute effective functioning in a very short period of time and cost
        effectively. This is done through scientific screening systems, that
        are not subjective to anyone’s perceptions; be it a false self perception
        or a perception within an organization of what motivates their
        staff.</p>
		<p><a href="index.jsp?pg=24">First Time Right</a></p>
		<p>One of the many unnecessary costs in major organizations is the
        frequency in which some staff have to be replaced. Staff are trained
        into a specific job at enormous costs and after two or three months we
        discover one or more of the following scenario's :</p>
        <p>
        	<ul>
        	<li>Despite the trainee having the necessary qualifications; although proficient, they may be found to be totally inefficient.</li>
        	<li>The trainee is unsuitable for the trained position.</li>
        	<li>The trainee leaves because of being head hunted due to training received.</li>
        	<li>The trainee is not efficient in what they do, despite their successful training.</li>
        	<li>The trainee does not function optimally and starts becoming dysfunctional.</li>
        	<li>The trainee causes other staff members to dysfunction.</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
        <p>The FQGlobal Group's scientific systems will get the equation right the first time; by scientifically placing the right person in the right job, in the right environment.</p>
