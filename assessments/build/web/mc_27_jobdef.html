<h3>Job Definition, Profiles, and Matching</h3>

<h4>Job Definition:</h4>
<p>Organizations and Small Business alike are faced with the challenges of describing a job profile in which the business values can be incorporated. It is a researched fact that all recruitment agencies and human resource managers, are unable to recruit individuals according to a scientifically based job description.</p>

<p>The recruitment industry has for generations tried to recruit and fit a candidate into a job profile without the consideration of the environment. The reality is that unless the environment is taken into account, everything else would become a secondary factor. Thus once one can define an environment, it becomes easy to place someone in a position that satisfies the inner potential of the candidate and at the same time create a working environment in which the candidate can function optimally in harmony within their working environment.</p>

<p>Personality and qualifications play an essential role in fulfilling a job profile. The real problem lies in these facts:</p>
	
<ul>
<li>It is not necessarily correct to assume that a candidate would fit into a certain working environment despite the fact that the candidate is qualified.</li>
<li>Because of their qualifications and experience, it does not necessarily mean that they would fit the environment.</li>
<li>It also does not mean that because they are qualified, they would be efficient and/or proficient in any specified job that they are either working in, or are considering working in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore it is critical that each business or organization scientifically satisfies the Job Values with the candidate's Personal Values which is subject  to the Hierarchy of Importance to both parties.</p>

<p>People function according to values that are important to them and if the personal values of the candidate are congruent with the job values, then and then only will the secondary constructs such as qualification, personality, and skills, become relevant factors.</p>


<h4>Job Profiles:</h4>

<p>The job values are scientifically obtained through a questionnaire which would set  them into an order of hierarchy. This profile is normally completed by a number of people, for example: Human Resource Consultants, Company Managers or Sectional Managers under which the candidate would work. The common sets of values are then organized according to a hierarchy of necessity. </p>

<h4>The Match:</h4>

<p>Once the organization or small business has set the job profile, the applicants or staff members complete an Organization Screening Inventory in which their holistic functionality is measured and their hierarchy of personal values are matched according to their preferences, against the working environment in which they would be required to work or are presently working.</p>

<h4><u>In this would lie the ultimate judgment of success.</u></h4>
