<h3>Organizational Screening Inventory</h3>

<p><span class='green1'>Question:</span>  How is the Organization  Functioning?</p>

<p>This question in reality is the most incorrectly answered question in the business world today.</p>
<ul>
	<li>An organization's performance is measured by the trading figures and the return to the shareholders.</li>
	<li>The trading figures could be very good, but this of course, does not necessarily mean that the organization is functioning optimally.</li>
	<li>The reality is that although the organization is making profits, it is far from the correct interpretation to presume that the organization is functioning optimally.</li>
	<li>It has become increasingly important to understand the Functional Intelligence of staff members within the organization.</li>
	<li>It is important for management to be able, with assertiveness, to have the right person in the right job, in the right environment.</li>
</ul>


<h4>The Uncovering of Realities:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The greatest error that organizations are making in business today, is that the environment is not considered in the equation when working with, or recruiting staff.</li>
	<li>Organizations are using many different  tests or assessments, to try and obtain an understanding of the candidate's personality, ability, emotions, etc, without successfully identifying the critical elements i.e. the environmental effects of the different staff members within that defined working environment.</li>
	<li>It is critical in today's society to get this equation right, as daily fraud, theft, stress, frustration, loyalty, moral values, coping ability, strikes, absenteeism and numerous other constructs are having massive impacts on the staff and organizations alike.</li>
	<li>A person can be very competent, have the right personality, have the right qualifications etc, but if the environment is not conducive to the candidate's functionality, one will not achieve the efficacious environment, that the organization is trying to achieve, despite the different methodologies used to optimize organization functionality and efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Organization  Functioning: </h4>

<p>In functionality terms, the trading of the organization is known as the GBS (General Behavioral System) and the staff is the IIS  (Inner Interactive System), both of which are the systems that make the organization function. The latter (IIS) being very significant in the well being of the organization. Unfortunately the IIS are the most neglected in so far as management's understanding of human functionality is concerned, both in the private and corporate sectors alike.</p>
<p>This lack of understanding is coming to the fore as more and more organizations strive for efficiency and productivity, yet are becoming less efficient and service orientated through the dysfunctional attitude or behavior of their staff.</p>
<p>It is no longer being considered acceptable for management  to use fear tactics and money to try and obtain their objectives, because in the medium and long term the staff members go into "coping" modes and then into a total dysfunctional mode whereby they no longer can continue within that environment.</p>
<p>Organizations have huge budgets for development, training and motivational programs. Unfortunately, the return on investment (R.O.I.) is not producing effective results due to the lack of functional intelligence, which is the functional understanding of the holistic performance of an individual or group of individuals.</p>

<p>The big question that arises is how does management determine this knowledge and create the necessary environment wherein the R.O.I. would become a feasible reality?  The answer is actually very simple for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
   <li>By understanding the staff's preferences in their personal functionality constructs (areas).</li>
   <li>By understanding the staff's personal functioning constructs and then by scientifically defining the job values within that specific working environment. </li>
   <li>By matching both the personal and defined work area values, we would create a match, which would result in harmony within the working environment.</li>
   <li>If the staff members are efficient at work, it is a fantasy to assume that all are functioning optimally. Although efficient, they could be in "coping" mode. </li>
   <li>If a staff member is "coping", they are on a spiraling dysfunctional mode and any extra training or work load added to their daily tasks, could have a devastating effect on the relevant behaviour of the candidate, colleagues or families of the candidate.</li>
   <li>These results play a huge role on the life styles of all concerned.</li>
   <li>Once staff members reach the dysfunctional "clinical cut off point", they could start irrational behavior and could inflict serious damage to themselves, colleagues, family and/or company property.</li>
   <li>This state of functioning disorder is occurring regularly, as the abuse of colleagues, partners and children are running out of control internationally.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Believe it or Not:</h4>

<p>Recently, a staff member walked into his workplace at a huge organization and for no apparent reason shot his supervisor.</p>

<ul>
   <li>The reality is that, this employee's behaviour took a considerable amount of time to reach that point of total irrational thinking.</li>
   <li>The Human Resource Manager had been warned by FQGlobal, since a few functioning profiles had been completed within that specific department. </li>
   <li>Through a few personal profiles it became eminent  that a few of the staff in that department had over-activated negative constructs.</li>
   <li>These constructs had passed the clinical cut off point, where rationality in the behaviour of those candidates would be unpredictable.</li>
   <li>Instead of dealing with the problem, the organization employed extra security to prevent people with firearms entering into the building.</li>
   <li>The reality is that the organization has not attempted to solve the true problem.</li>
   <li>They were assuming that not allowing firearms would solve the problem. While in reality a person who have passed the clinical cut off point, could use any sharp object (i.e. a scissor), or even any blunt object (i.e. a brick) to achieve the same objective, which of course makes the organization just as vulnerable as before.</li>
   <li>The reality is that there are still several over-activated employees functioning in that same environment.</li>
   <li>The answer would be simple, but the organization does not seem to want to solve the problem, due to personal status, resulting in the continuation of denial that there is a human resource problem within their organizational environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research further showed some interesting facts, which was recently again confirmed by the results from one of the IT Organizations which used the FQGlobal Group's Organizational Screening Inventory:</p>

<ul>
   <li>That the effective functioning of staff members were as low as 22%.</li>
   <li>In one department, of this large IT organization, there were 23 staff members, of whom only 4 of the 23 were functioning effectively.</li>
   <li>Two of their key accounting personnel had been put on a management training course and both were in an advanced stage of breakdown - they both had exceeded the clinical cut off point in four different functioning constructs!</li>
   <li>This in real terms means that their ability to function rationally and logically became questionable.</li>
   <li>Management were shocked to learn about these facts. </li>
   <li>The staff members needed therapeutic intervention by professional therapists immediately to stabilize their functionality. </li>
</ul>
