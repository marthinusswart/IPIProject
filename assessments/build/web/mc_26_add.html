		<p><b>The ADD Hyper Active Child</b></p>
		<p><b>The Understanding</b></p>
		<p>The modern schools of today are geared for numbers and the teachers therefore put a lot of pressure on parents to have the child doped so as to make the child less problematic.</p>
		<p>It is like taking an athlete and giving them a sleeping tablet before they run a race. Yet the child under these circumstances are expected to perform effectively.</p>
		<p>ADD Hyper-active children are normally very bright young people and understand things very quickly so they have to be managed differently from the average student; if there is such a students that can be classified or defined as average or normal?</p>
		<p>We must understand the reality; that all people are uniquely different and everyone reacts to certain events differently in the same environment. However, the means by which children
           are managed is concerning, as we do not address the real cause of the problem. The problem did NOT originate with the child and usually it is NOT the child that is the problem.</p>
		<p>People are consistently under a deception that a young child can rationalize by discussion, which of course is not true, until they are at a age (approx 13 years upwards) when they only start
           rationalizing effectively. This is the time that the drug dependency and suicide starts manifesting, due to the fact, that when they start rationalizing; they find it difficult to cope with the realities of life.</p>
		<p>The following labels are given to ADD or Hyper-active children. Avoid these negative labels at all costs and use the positive labels in their place. Here are a few of the comparisons.</p>

		<p>Remember the child needs a lot of attention and love by parents; but within that love environment, a disciplined life style is essential, and not some drug to keep them suppressed, to make it easier for someone to control them, and suppress the reality of whom they really are.</p>
