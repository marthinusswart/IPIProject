		<p><b class='green2'>Ecology</b> is the study of the behaviour and functioning of organisms in their environment.</p>
		<p><b class='green2'>Ecometrics</b> is the quantification by measurement of human functioning in their environment and was coined in early 1960 by a Professor van Zyl.</p>
		<p><b class='green2'>Ecometry</b> is the study of Human functioning and behaviour in their environment and has been a researched subject over a period of&nbsp; ± 44&nbsp; years. The leaders in this field&nbsp; was made up of Prof A Faul,&nbsp; Dr. Beatrix
			  Horne, Prof J. Hudson and many others, who were researching the scientific social behaviour of man.&nbsp;We acknowledge and thank them for their research and results, which we have continued to develop and refine
			  into a new order known as <b class='green2'>Functional Intelligence.<sup>TM</sup></b></p>
		<p><b class='green2'>Functional Intelligence<sup>TM</sup></b></p>
		<p>Is the occupation in which <b class='green2'>ecometrics</b> is used for quantification of criteria in human behaviour in a given environment and the name was coined by Dr. Neil Whitehouse in 2002.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Functional intelligence will give us scientific knowledge to enable us to become both efficient and effective.</li>
				<li>That knowledge or intelligence would enable us to fulfil our inner potential.</li>
				<li>In so doing would allow one to lead a fulfilled lifestyle.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>It is a tool for the exact identification and quantification of core criteria effecting human functionality within a specific environment.</li>
				<li>It is the holistic importance of personal likes and dislikes and personal beliefs between what is right or wrong which makes up the preferences known as Personal Values within a specific environment.</li>
				<li>It quantifies the intensity of the effects of those personal values on an individual within that environment.</li>

		<p><b class='green2'>Question:</b></p>
		<p>What would make something true?</p>
		<p><b class='green2'>Truth:&nbsp;</b> Genuine, actual fact,&nbsp; Reality.&nbsp;(Webster's International Dictionary)</p>
  		<p><b class='green2'>Truth</b> is defined as a reality. Something that is a fact or an action becomes truth.</p>
  		<p><b class='green3'><i>"The understanding of truth is a real privilege, failing which, the reality will sort you out"</i></b></p>
  		
  		<p><b class='green2'>Ultimately</b></p>
  		<p><b class='green2'>Truth</b> is <b class='green2'>NOT</b> a belief in something that has a deception that looks like truth, but in reality is not a true fact. This is really prominent in religious circles where people have different beliefs, which are not necessarily true and one seems to get past this by allowing fantasy to become a norm.</p>
  		<p><ul>
		   	<li>What we are saying here is, it is not necessarily true that what you believe in is true.</li>
		   	<li>Deception in this modern world of ours, has become the order of the day and thousands upon thousands of people live in deception, believing that they are living in truth</li>
		 	</ul></p>
		<p>An examples of this is: 'I believe that the world is flat'.</p>
		<p><ul>
			<li>That is a fantasy of my imagination and can never be true because in the reality the world is round.</li>
			<li>There are many hours of wasted debate with a number of qualified professionals who state that if someone believes something to be true it becomes their truth, because they believe it to be so.</li>
			<li>It is difficult to rationalize such statements and the truth in the reality will sort them out at the end of the day.</li>
		   </ul>
		</p>
		<p><b class='green2'>Value Intelligence :</b> is the scientific understanding of the true criteria that makes up the likes and dislikes; amalgamated with the beliefs between right and wrong that lies within the "self" of any individual.</p>
		</div>
		<p><b class='green2'>This method of identifying personal truths is a measurement system produced by FQGlobal through scientific formulae, and has been validated for both reliability and validity (<i>Coefficient Alpha</i> and <i>Standard Error Measurement System</i>) which are in accordance to the present law requirements and world measurement standards.</b></p>
