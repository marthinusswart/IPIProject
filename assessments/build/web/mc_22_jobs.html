		<p>Black Economic Empowerment has been an essential ingredient to execute growth and stability in our country. The present disadvantage to Black Economic
      		Empowerment is that black people are placed in jobs for the sake of fulfilling a law requirement or to obtain government business contracts;
      		without fulfilling the needs and the abilities of the person themselves.</p>
