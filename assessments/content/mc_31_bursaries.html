<p>There are millions of young people today that are hunting for bursaries in order to improve their higher education which would in turn satisfy their prospects of a better future.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it can become a very expensive task to try and establish :</p>
	

<ul>
<li>The correct CV format that would reach the target of the bursary being offered.</li>
<li>The cost of having a CV done by an expert, in order for the presentation of the CV to be impressive.</li>
<li>The regular searches through the media to ensure that when each and every bursary is advertised you knows about it and apply for it. Further you have to try to ensure that your application for the bursary, at least gets the attention that it deserves.</li>
<li>The frustration of living in hope of finding a bursary and never getting even the courtesy of a reply, and even if one did get acknowledgment of a reply, there is practically no follow-up.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FQGlobal Group is introducing a system whereby potential students can apply for bursaries and do a standard CV on-line. Within that application we determine all the student's strong points through a scientific process. </p>

<p>We are encouraging all major organizations to register their bursaries with us, whereby they are saving thousands of Rand in advertisements and know they are getting students who are most likely to be successful. </p>

<p>For Students:</p>
<ul>	
<li>Different Organizations have their bursaries and job positions scientifically ratified through us, therefore the candidate only registers once on-line and thereafter have access to job positions and all different bursary opportunities from all organizations registered with us.</li>
<li>This gives each candidate the possibilities of exposure to different jobs and bursaries that are available.</li>
<li>This also enables candidates to receive electronic feedback on a regular base.</li>
<li>This system gives all people an equal opportunity, including even the most disadvantaged person from the most remote areas. It gives each person the ability to access opportunities on strength of their ability and not on the strength of a sophisticated written CV (which are written by a third party) or being wrongly penalized by a prejudiced selection process.</li>
<li>The system is very efficient.  When someone registers, it immediately searches for bursaries or jobs and then matches the candidate's ability to the job/bursary profile. Should there be no opportunity at the time of application, the system will continue to search the database as soon as new jobs or bursaries are added, until it finds a job/bursary profile that matches the candidate's profile. The system would also keep the candidate informed of the progress that his or her listing on our database is making.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Advantages to the Candidate:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Various bursaries are on one website.</li>
<li>Candidates only have to apply once - our system will automatically submit their details to all organizations for whose bursaries or jobs the candidate qualifies.</li>
<li>Candidates need not continue applying for many different positions.</li>
<li>First time right selection - no need to apply for a bursary to study something in which the candidate will not be happy.</li>
<li>Recruitment biases are eliminated.</li>
<li>Find the correct job, to satisfy a fulfilled lifestyle.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Advantages to the Organizations offering bursaries:</h4>
<ul>	
<li>No need to work through thousands of applications. Only those candidates who fit the profile will be forwarded.</li>
<li>Reduction in advertisement costs.</li>
<li>First time right selection - lower drop-out rates, less money wasted.</li>
<li>High return on investment for the organization - since the candidate will be happy in his studies, he will be successful and the organization will reap the benefit.</li>
<li>Recruitment biases are eliminated.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cost:</h4>
<p>For a low, once-off registration fee, you will be placed on our database and you will be sent details to complete a personal value assessment. After completion of the assessment, you will be given feedback regarding your values and be given an indication of possible careers to be pursued. You can then go to our Career Planning section and get further information regarding the careers we suggested.</p>

<p>Once registered you remain on our system. Our system does make provision for you to inform us whether you want your status to be "active" or "dormant".  Active, is when our system will keep searching for a new opportunity that matches your personal profile. Dormant is typically when you found a new job and does not want to be informed of any new opportunities. However, should the situation change and you decide to change your status again to active, our system will immediately start matching your profile against our database of available positions.</p>
