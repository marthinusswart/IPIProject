		<h3>B.E.E.</h3>

		<b>Black Economic Empowerment</b> programs have long been the subject of many debates, with the following attributes being prevalent;</p>
  		<p>
  			<ul>
  			<li>They are essentially programs necessary to re-enfranchise previously disadvantaged groups.</li>
  			<li>They cause uncertainty and fear in all groups.</li>
  			<li>They can create animosity and resentment due to false perceptions of the reality.</li>
  			<li>Often people are appointed into positions that they are not suited to, and then criticized because they are not utilized through non-discovery of their inner potential.</li>
  		</ul>
  		</p>
  		<p>Too often, many people become a victim of abuse and are labelled as being inefficient or incompetent. Although this could be true in some circumstances, we must be careful not to label a person without first discovering their inner personal purpose and potential; because each person is unique. Many selections are made incorrectly, because the process does not include the environment in which they have to work. The working values should be scientifically defined and then matched with the candidates own personal values. Without all the criteria necessary for recruitment the whole system becomes an unjust and biased form of recruitment.</p>
   	<p>The reality lies in the fact that each person, by design, has certain built-in abilities and talents to excel in certain environments. Abraham Maslow states. "Let the violinist play the violin and let the pianist play the piano" meaning the violinist should not play the piano and vice versa.</p>
   	<p>Therefore it is essential that one makes sure that a person recruited for a particular job function, is suited to be the "violinist playing the violin within the environment in which he is suited" - one violinist may enjoy playing in a symphony orchestra, the other in a rock band. Thus environment is the primary factor when making a selection. </p>

   	<p><h4>Obtaining The Right Person For The Right Position</h4></p>
   	<p>One must understand that it is absolutely unjust to say that certain groups of people do not have ability. That is a totally false and prejudiced statement. Should employers choose a violinist to be a mechanic the chances of them being successful, irrespective of their ethnic grouping, would be remote and that is the problem that employers face daily in the realm of Black Economic Empowerment programs.</p>
   	<p>The reality is that there are thousands with the ability, but the challenge then arises on how would one be able to determine who the right candidate would be for a particular job description.</p>
   	
   	<p><h4>The Answer:</h4></p>
   	<p><b>Functional Intelligence <sup>TM</sup></b> is a scientific measuring tool that through a multitude of different, unbiased  functioning criteria, can and will determine any persons preferences as far as importance to that candidates functioning goes. One can then determine, what exactly that person’s abilities are and what career and environment that the candidate will excel in to satisfy that candidates personal purpose.</p>
   	<p>Should those abilities be congruent with the scientifically defined job profile, then and then only will that candidate be able to successfully be developed within that job environment</p>
   	<p>Many organizations are really battling to understand this fact. They do various analyses or tests to determine personalities and emotional functionality which will prove to be worthless should the environment not be clearly defined.</p>

  		<p><h4>The Way Forward:</h4></p>
  		<p>Each candidate must complete a profile that would define the candidate's personal abilities and functioning and thereafter be matched to a scientifically defined job profile according to environment. This is essential for people to plan their careers correctly in order to obtain the most suitable position in any organization.</p>
