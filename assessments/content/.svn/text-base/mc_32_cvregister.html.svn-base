<p>Send e-mail to <a href="mailto:registration@functionalintelligence.com?Subject=FQG Web: CV Registration">registration@functionalintelligence.com</a>  requesting registration.</p>

<p>You need to state the following:</p>
<ul>	
<li>Your full names and surname</li>
<li>Your I.D. or social security number</li>
<li>Telephone and/or Mobile phone number</li>
<li>E-mail address is essential. (If you do not have an e-mail address, several websites offer free e-mail accounts, e.g. www.yahoo.com, www.hotmail.com, and others.)</li>
<li>Instructions will be send to you electronically, together with your unique user name and password.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tips for completing the registration information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not try to manipulate the profile as we guarantee detection thereof! This would disqualify you for any bursary or job offer. Do not waste your money - because when we detect manipulation you won't be placed on the database and no refund will be given either.</li>
<li>Follow instructions and complete the CV on-line.</li>
<li>Complete your personal profile.  All questions needs to be completed.  You will not be able to proceed from one set of questions to the next, if all questions have not been answered.</li>
<li>When you completed the personal profile, please send us an e-mail, confirming that you have completed it. It is fine to just send an email stating "Profile Completed" and include your name.</li>
<li>We will then inform you electronically, keeping you informed on the progress of your application. Would there be a match between your profile and a job/bursary profile, our system would send an e-mail to inform you that your details went through to a company for review and the company will directly contact you then.</li>
<li>Looking forward to be of assistance to you.</li>
</ul>
