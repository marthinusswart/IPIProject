		<p><h3>Key Benefits that make Functional Intelligence <i>Unique</i></h3></p>
		<p><ul>
			<li><i><u>Personal Environmental Effects:</u></i> i.e. it is the way the environment effects the individual person.  
			<li><i><u>Job Profile:</u></i> it is the scientifically defined criteria required to satisfy the particular job value.
			<li><i><u>Candidate's Functionality Profile:</u></i> the profile scientifically defines the criteria effecting the holistic functioning of the individual within their holistic environment. Environments are made up of various systems and the roles that people play within those environments.
			<li><i><u>Matching Configuration:</u></i> i.e. it is the scientific matching of the job profile to the candidate's functioning profile.
			<li>Measures the IIS (Inner Interactive System) which is the Inner Self Perception. One can impress people through &quot;impression management&quot;, but one cannot fool oneself.
			<li>Measures the GBS (General Behavioural System) which is what you portray as a person. In other words it gives the observer sight of how the person feels or doesn't feel. (That is taking someone at face value.)
			<li>The assessment cannot be manipulated without detection. The reason is that humans function congruently, therefore all the various constructs have to glove in harmony with all other constructs. Any inconsistency would prove manipulation.
			<li>From the beginning, recruit the correct person in the correct position.
			<li>When the job meets the values or what is important to the person, it creates harmony in the working environment.
			<li>It measures the effectiveness of criteria in relationship to the individual's functionality.  
			<li>High Return on Investment (i.e. in the form of a happy staff and better output which result in higher profits versus the capital outlay to have the assessments done).
			</ul>
